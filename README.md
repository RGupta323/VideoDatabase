# VideoDatabase
Creates a database using python and mysql that just has a bunch of video links which can be played through the same program. 

This is not finished! 

Much progress has been made... 
(2/24/18)
Able to connect to database successfully
Able to make tables, get information, and insert information
Able to create a dictionary of all the tags within the VIDEOS table and have those tags via loop to have their own table. 
Those tables created now have the title and url of the video inserted. 

(2/25/18) 
Classes of Playlist and Entry created in Search.py. 
Implemented the opening of URLs in webbrowser via webbrowser library 
Search.py has been finished and tested. 
Project mostly done. 


What to do next...
Change webbrowser() function just a bit so that it opens up in chrome and hopefully opens up the url right into youtube instead of just searching it first.
