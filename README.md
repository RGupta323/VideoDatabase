# VideoDatabase
Creates a database using python and mysql that just has a bunch of video links which can be played through the same program. 

This is not finished! 

Much progress has been made... 
(2/24/18)
Able to connect to database successfully
Able to make tables, get information, and insert information
Able to create a dictionary of all the tags within the VIDEOS table and have those tags via loop to have their own table. 
Those tables created now have the title and url of the video inserted. 

What to do next...
For effieicny, make sure that when table() is being run that duplicate information isn't being enetered, 
Implement search function so if the user types a word or phrase or a video he/she wants then the program should search through the entire database through title, and tags and then list out all the videos that are within that category. 
Finally, implement a urllibparser that is able to open urls once the user decides to watch a certain video...
