#WebScraper.py
#So essentially the whole point of the branch called WebScraper is to
#basically have a continous adding function.
#So the user would run the main.py script, and well if they got lazy and didn't
#want to supply a .txt file or type in stuff the program would just essentailly
#search the internet by itself and webscrape the urls it would visit, and
#then by itself add those videos into the database
#Essentially they would just type what they want, like "Star Wars" or "SWTOR"
#or whatever they want and then specify how many entries they wanted.
#If they didn't specify the default would be 10.

#Programming wise it would use search() from googles interface, and essentially
#look for a title and the url, because that's all I would need.
